This repo contains Kicad files for an Odrive encoder adapter board.

This board plugs in to your Odrive and gives you connectors for your encoders.

It uses 5 pin JST XH connectors and works great with ABZ encoders or hall sensors.

See parts_list.txt for a parts list.

Order the PCB directly from OSHPark here:

This board was designed by Taylor Alexander for Twisted Fields LLC.
